## Game

The game is meant to be played with NERF toy guns but can be played with other equipment such as airsoft. One person is picked at random to become the zombie who will then choose 3 **passphrases** to the program (see the get started for more details). He will then write the **phrases** down on 3 papers that he will hide. After that everyone is released to look for the passphrases and the zombie will turn into a zombie when he see fit.

If he touches another player that player will also become a zombie and if he gets hit by a NERF gun the he must be still for 10 seconds. The players win by inputting all of the phrases and the zombies win if everyone becomes zombies.
